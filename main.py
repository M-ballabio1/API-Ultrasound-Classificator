description = """
**Mobile-Net classificator implemented in Tensorflow** and if you want to interact with API using a UI, go to Streamlit application.

This API is created for scientific purpose to support explaination of scientific paper about MLOps.
The goal was the deployment of deep learning model in production using the best practice of MLOps science.

### Author and Contributors:

- Matteo Ballabio (author)

- Matteo Testi (contributor)

### Usage:

- Input: ultrasound image (suggested 224x224x1)

- Output: json file with classification probability

### Limit Usage:

There's a fix limit to HTTPs API's requests (each Ip address can send 5 https request for day)
